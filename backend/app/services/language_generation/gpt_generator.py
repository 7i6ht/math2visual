You are an expert at converting math story problem into a structured 'visual language'. Your task is to write a visual language expression based on the given math word problem.
    **Background information**
    You should use the following fixed format for each problem:
    <operation>(
    container1[entity_name: <entity name>, entity_type: <entity type>, entity_quantity: <number of this entity in this container>, container_name: <container name>, container_type: <container type>, attr_name: <attribute name>, attr_type: <attribute type>],
    container2[entity_name: <entity name>, entity_type: <entity type>, entity_quantity: <number of this entity in this container>, container_name: <container name>, container_type: <container type>, attr_name: <attribute name>, attr_type: <attribute type>],
    result_container[entity_name: <entity name>, entity_type: <entity type>, entity_quantity: <number of this entity in this container>, container_name: <container name>, container_type: <container type>, attr_name: <attribute name>, attr_type: <attribute type>]
    )
    operation can be ``addition'', ``subtraction'', ``multiplication'', ``division'', ``surplus'', ``area'', ``comparison'', or ``unittrans''.

Each entity has the attributes: entity_name, entity_type, entity_quantity, container_name, container_type, attr_name, attr_type. Name and type are different, for example, a girl named Lucy may be represented by entity_name: Lucy, entity_type: girl. The attributes container_name, container_type, attr_name and attr_type are optional and may vary according to different interpretations, only use them if you think they are necessary to clarify the entity.
In the math word problem description ``Jake picked up three apples in the morning...'' the container1 could be specified as entity_name: apple, entity_type: apple, entity_quantity: 3, container_name: Jake, container_type: boy, attr_name: morning, attr_type: morning.

**Examples**
We first provide you several example, please understand the logic clearly:
1. Question: Marin has nine apples and Donald has two apples. How many apples do Marin and Donald have together?
Visual language: addition(container1[entity_name: apple, entity_type: apple, entity_quantity:9 , container_name: Marin, container_type: girl, attr_name: , attr_type: ],container2[entity_name: apple, entity_type: apple, entity_quantity: 2, container_name: Donald, container_type: boy, attr_name: , attr_type: ], result_container[entity_name:apple,entity_type:apple,entity_quantity:11 , container_name:Marin and Donald, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: Here addition describe the computation relationship between container1 and container2. We choose the entity as the thing corresponding to quantity, so the quantity is describing that entity. "entity_type" represent entity's visual representation name while "entity_name" is its apparent name. Like a boy has name Bob, so "entity_name" is Bob, "entity_type" is boy because we visualize he as a boy. container_name and container_type represent an attribute that you think is necessary in this question and we will make this attribute as the container of this entity to show a ownership relation, only add it if you think it do not cause confusion. If all entity share same container, please only give "container_name" and "container_type" value to result_container and leave other container blank. Only give value to attr_type, attr_name if you found "container_name" and "container_type" is not enough so we provide one more attribute to identify this entity. The result_container describe the result of this computation, their entity_name usually is the same as container1 and container2, their entity_quantity is the computation result, their container_name and container_type describe the container of the final result.

2. Question: If Carl has a total of 89 stamps and Kevin has 57, how many more stamps does Carl have more than Kevin?
Visual language: subtraction(container1[entity_name: stamp, entity_type: stamp, entity_quantity: 89, container_name: Carl, container_type: boy, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: stamp, entity_type: stamp, entity_quantity: 57, container_name: Kevin, container_type: boy, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:stamp,entity_type:stamp,entity_quantity:32 , container_name:Carl have more, container_type: more, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: Here subtraction is another relationship. The result_container has container_name: Carl have more, and container_type is more.

3. Question: There are 10 books on a shelf. 3 of them are history books, 5 of them are geography books and the rest are math books. How many math books are there on the shelf?
Visual language: subtraction(subtraction(container1[entity_name: total books, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 10, container_name: shelf, container_type: shelf, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: history books, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 3, container_name: history books, container_type: history, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: minus history books, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 7, container_name: , container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:]), container2[entity_name: geography books, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 5, container_name: geography books, container_type: geography, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name:math books, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 2,container_name:math books, container_type:math, attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: here is an example of continuous subtraction, we should try to use less relationship like here we only use multiple subtractions instead of using subtraction and addition, notice each single computation has one result_container.

4. Question: For the fifth grade play, the chairs have been put into 27 rows with 16 chairs in each row. How many chairs have been put out for the play?
Visual language: multiplication(container1[entity_name: chair, entity_type: chair, entity_quantity: 16, container_name: row, container_type: row, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: multiplier, entity_type: multiplier, entity_quantity: 27, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name:chair,entity_type:chair,entity_quantity:432 , container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: Here multiplication is another relationship. And row/column is necessary in visual representation so we put it in container_name and container_type

5. Question: Lexie's younger brother helped pick up all the paper clips in Lexie's room. He was able to collect 21 paper clips. If he wants to distribute the paper clips in 3 boxes, how many paper clips will each box contain?
Visual language: division(container1[entity_name: paper clip, entity_type: paper-clip, entity_quantity: 21, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: box, entity_type: box, entity_quantity: 3, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: paper clip per box, entity_type: paper clip per box, entity_quantity: 7, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: here the divider is the box, so the result_container has container paper clips per box. If the question is about fixing the number of paper clip per box and asking how many boxes, then the result_container should have container as box.

6. Question: There were 36 dogs and 29 cats in a pet center. After 20 of the dogs were adopted by people, the pet center collected another 12 cats. How many pets were there in the pet center in the end?
Visual language: addition(subtraction(addition(container1[entity_name: dog, entity_type: dog, entity_quantity: 36, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: cat, entity_type: cat, entity_quantity: 29, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], 
result_container[entity_name:animal,entity_type:animal,entity_quantity:65,container_name:,container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),container2[entity_name: dog, entity_type: dog, entity_quantity: 20, container_name: adopt, container_type: adopt, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:animal,entity_type:animal,entity_quantity:45,container_name:,container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),container2[entity_name: cat, entity_type: cat, entity_quantity: 12, container_name: collect, container_type: collect, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:animal,entity_type:animal,entity_quantity:57,container_name:pet center,container_type:pet-center,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: This example show we can nesting relationship to express multiple relationships. We write computation in time series order, and as pet center represent the total results, we only put it as the container of the last result_container.

7. Question: Mrs. Santiago has 58 red roses. Mrs. Garrett has 24. What's the difference of the number of Mrs. Santiago's red roses and Mrs. Garrett's red roses?
Visual language: subtraction(container1[entity_name: red rose, entity_type: red-rose, entity_quantity: 58, container_name:Mrs. Santiago, container_type:woman, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: red rose, entity_type: red-rose, entity_quantity: 24, container_name:Mrs. Garrett, container_type:woman, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name: red rose, entity_type: red-rose, entity_quantity: 34, container_name:difference, container_type:difference, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: For those difference problem, we still use subtraction relationship to express it.

8. Question: An airline has 41 pieces of luggage to put away. If each luggage compartment will hold 5 pieces of luggage, how many will be in the compartment that isn't full?
Visual language: surplus(container1[entity_name: luggage, entity_type: luggage, entity_quantity: 41, container_name:airline, container_type:airline, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: luggage, entity_type: luggage, entity_quantity: 5, container_name:compartment, container_type:compartment, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name: luggage,entity_type: luggage, entity_quantity: 1,container_name: compartment,container_type: compartment,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: Here surplus is another relationship, we compute the surplus of container1 divided by container2.

9. Question: If you have 1 ten dollar bill, 1 quarter and 1 nickel, how much money do you have?
Visual language: addition(addition(unittrans(container1[entity_name: ten dollar bill, entity_type: ten-dollar-bill, entity_quantity: 1, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 10, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity:10, container_name:, container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),unittrans(container1[entity_name: quarter, entity_type: quarter, entity_quantity: 1, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 0.25, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type:dollar,entity_quantity:0.25,container_name:,container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type:dollar,entity_quantity:10.25,container_name:,container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),unittrans(container1[entity_name: nickel, entity_type: nickel, entity_quantity: 1, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 0.05, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type:dollar,entity_quantity:0.05,container_name:,container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type:dollar,entity_quantity:10.30,container_name:you,container_type:human,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: Here unittrans means unit transformation, it is another relationship between entity and its unittrans_value. Like in this example, a ten-dollar-bill have value of 10 dollars, so the name of container2 is dollar, the type is unittrans_value, and quantity is 10.

10. Question: Rug A is 8 feet by 4 feet, and Rug B is 5 feet by 7 feet. Which rug should Mrs. Hilt buy if she wants the rug with the biggest area?
Visual language: comparison(area(container1[entity_name: feet, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 8, container_name:length, container_type:length, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name:feet, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 4, container_name:width, container_type:width, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name:area,entity_type:area,entity_quantity:32 , container_name:Rug A, container_type:rug, attr_name:, attr_type:]),area(container1[entity_name: feet, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 5, container_name:length, container_type:length, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name:feet, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 7, container_name:width, container_type:width, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:area,entity_type:area,entity_quantity:35 , container_name:Rug B, container_type:rug, attr_name:, attr_type:]),result_container[entity_name:Rug B,entity_type:rug,entity_quantity: , container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: Here comparison and area are two new relationships. "comparison" comparing the quantity of two entity, the two entity can be the result of other computation like in this example, the name of result_container indicate the comparison result.
"area" is computing the area value by its two input entities, the container1 represent length while container2 represents width as indicated by container, name is unit. The container_name and container_type of result_container indicate the item this area belong to.

11. Question: Ellen has six more balls than Marin. Marin has nine balls. How many balls does Ellen have?
Visual language: addition(container1[entity_name: ball, entity_type: ball, entity_quantity: 9, container_name: Marin, container_type: girl, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: ball, entity_type: ball, entity_quantity: 6, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:ball,entity_type:ball,entity_quantity:15,container_name:Ellen,container_type:boy,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: In this case, the added results are the balls Ellen has, so we do not add Ellen in the container of container2 because it will cause the confusion that Ellen own 6 balls.

12. Question: Isha's pencil is 22 inches long. If she sharpens two inches off on Monday and two inches on Tuesday, how long will her pencil be then?
Visual language: subtraction(subtraction(container1[entity_name: inch, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 22, container_name: pencil, container_type: pencil, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: inch, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 2, container_name: Monday, container_type: calendar, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:inch,entity_type:measure,entity_quantity:20,container_name:pencil,container_type:pencil,attr_name:,attr_type:]), container2[entity_name: inch, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 2, container_name: Tuesday, container_type: calendar, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:inch,entity_type:measure,entity_quantity:18,container_name:pencil,container_type:pencil,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: In this case, if the attr is a name of a day of the week(Monday,Sunday, yesterday, tomorrow...) or a year or a month, we can use calendar as type to visualize it. Similar if its a time, we can use clock as type. And for inch or other length, we can use measure as type. The last result_container should use the overall container of this item, like pencil here.

13. Question: The Hawks scored three touchdowns worth 7 points each. How many points do they have?
Visual language: multiplication(container1[entity_name: point, entity_type: point, entity_quantity: 7, container_name: touchdown, container_type: touchdown, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: multiplier, entity_type: multiplier, entity_quantity: 3, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:point,entity_type:point,entity_quantity:21,container_name:Hawks,container_type:hawks,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: Here the entity_name is point instead of touchdown because the quantity 7 is corresponding to point not touchdown, and we put touchdown in container as it owns these points. You can imagine multiplication as we repeat one box multiple times, here the box is touchdown and points are item inside each box. And finally Hawks is the container of the result_container as it owns all the box.

14. Question: A game spinner has 5 equal parts. Two parts are blue and three parts are purple. Which color would you most likely spin?
Visual language: comparison(container1[entity_name: blue part, entity_type: blue-part, entity_quantity: 2, container_name: , container_type: , attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: purple part, entity_type: purple-part, entity_quantity: 3, container_name: , container_type: , attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:purple part,entity_type:purple-part,entity_quantity:,container_name:,container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: If the item is some color part, you can refer it as color-part, like red-part.

15. Question: There are 10 books on a shelf. 3 of them are history books, 5 of them are geography books and the rest are math books. How many math books are there on the shelf?
Visual language: subtraction(subtraction(container1[entity_name: total books, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 10, container_name: shelf, container_type: shelf, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: history books, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 3, container_name: history books, container_type: history-book, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: minus history books, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 7, container_name: , container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:]), container2[entity_name: geography books, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 5, container_name: geography books, container_type: geography-book, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name:math books, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 2,container_name:math books, container_type:math-book, attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: When there are continuous subtractions, please always use subtraction relationship. In general try to use fewer kinds of relationship to represent the question. And here, the entity_name and entity_type should distinguish history book and geography book.

16. Question: Mrs. Hilt has two pennies, two dimes, and two nickels. Jacob has four pennies, one nickel, and one dime. Who has more money?
Visual language: comparison(addition(addition(unittrans(container1[entity_name: penny, entity_type: penny, entity_quantity: 2, container_name: Mrs.Hilt, container_type: woman, attr_name: , attr_type: ], container2[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 0.01, container_name: Mrs.Hilt, container_type: woman, attr_name: , attr_type: ], result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity: 0.02, container_name: Mrs.Hilt, container_type: woman, attr_name: , attr_type: ]), unittrans(container1[entity_name: dime, entity_type: dime, entity_quantity: 2, container_name: Mrs.Hilt, container_type: woman, attr_name: , attr_type: ], container2[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 0.1, container_name: Mrs.Hilt, container_type: woman, attr_name: , attr_type: ], result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity: 0.2, container_name: Mrs.Hilt, container_type: woman, attr_name: , attr_type: ]), result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity: 0.22, container_name:Mrs.Hilt , container_type:woman , attr_name: , attr_type: ]), unittrans(container1[entity_name: nickel, entity_type: nickel, entity_quantity: 2, container_name:Mrs.Hilt , container_type:woman , attr_name: , attr_type: ], container2[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 0.05, container_name:Mrs.Hilt , container_type:woman , attr_name: , attr_type: ], result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity: 0.1, container_name:Mrs.Hilt , container_type:woman , attr_name: , attr_type: ]), result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity: 0.32, container_name: Mrs.Hilt, container_type: woman, attr_name: , attr_type: ]), addition(addition(unittrans(container1[entity_name: penny, entity_type: penny, entity_quantity: 4, container_name:Jacob , container_type:man , attr_name: , attr_type: ], container2[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 0.01, container_name:Jacob , container_type:man , attr_name: , attr_type: ], result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity: 0.04, container_name:Jacob , container_type:man , attr_name: , attr_type: ]), unittrans(container1[entity_name: dime, entity_type: dime, entity_quantity: 1, container_name:Jacob , container_type:man , attr_name: , attr_type: ], container2[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 0.1, container_name:Jacob , container_type:man , attr_name: , attr_type: ], result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity: 0.1, container_name:Jacob , container_type:man , attr_name: , attr_type: ]), result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity: 0.14, container_name:Jacob , container_type:man , attr_name: , attr_type: ]), unittrans(container1[entity_name: nickel, entity_type: nickel, entity_quantity: 1, container_name:Jacob , container_type:man , attr_name: , attr_type: ], container2[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 0.05, container_name:Jacob , container_type:man , attr_name: , attr_type: ], result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity: 0.05, container_name:Jacob , container_type:man , attr_name: , attr_type: ]), result_container[entity_name: dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity: 0.19, container_name: Jacob, container_type: man, attr_name: , attr_type: ]), result_container[entity_name: more, entity_type: more, entity_quantity: , container_name: more, container_type: more, attr_name: , attr_type: ]) 

17. Question: Mrs. Hilt bought a yoyo for 24 cents and a whistle for 14 cents. How much did she spend in all for the two toys?
Visual language: addition(container1[entity_name: cent, entity_type: cent, entity_quantity: 24, container_name: yoyo, container_type: yoyo, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: cent, entity_type: cent, entity_quantity: 14, container_name: whistle, container_type: whistle, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: cent, entity_type: cent, entity_quantity: 38, container_name: Mrs. Hilt, container_type: woman, attr_name:, attr_type:])

18. Question: Mrs. Hilt spent 25 cents on one caramel apple and 15 cents on one ice cream cone. How much more did the apple cost?
Visual language: subtraction(container1[entity_name: cent, entity_type: cent, entity_quantity: 25, container_name: caramel apple, container_type: caramel-apple, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: cent, entity_type: cent, entity_quantity: 15, container_name: ice cream cone, container_type: ice-cream-cone, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: cent, entity_type: cent, entity_quantity: 10, container_name: Mrs. Hilt, container_type: woman, attr_name:, attr_type:])

19. Question: Roden went to a pet shop. He bought 15 gold fish and 7 blue fish. How many fish did he buy?
Visual language: addition(container1[entity_name: gold fish, entity_type: gold-fish, entity_quantity: 15, container_name: Roden, container_type: boy, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: blue fish, entity_type: blue-fish, entity_quantity: 7, container_name: Roden, container_type: boy, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: fish, entity_type: fish, entity_quantity: 22, container_name: Roden, container_type: boy, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: we need to distinguish different fish here because their visual are different
                
20. Question: Tessa has 4 apples. Anita gave her 5 more. She needs 10 apples to make a pie. Does she have enough to make a pie?
Visual language: comparison(addition(container1[entity_name: apple, entity_type: apple, entity_quantity: 4, container_name: Tessa, container_type: girl, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: apple, entity_type: apple, entity_quantity: 5, container_name: Anita, container_type: girl, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: apple, entity_type: apple, entity_quantity: 9, container_name: Tessa, container_type: girl, attr_name:, attr_type:]),container2[entity_name: apple, entity_type: apple, entity_quantity: 10, container_name: pie, container_type: pie, attr_name:, attr_type:])
                
21. Question: Mrs. Snyder made 86 heart cookies. She made 36 red cookies and the rest are pink. How many pink cookies did she make?
Visual language: subtraction(container1[entity_name: total cookies, entity_type: heart-cookie, entity_quantity: 86, container_name: Mrs. Snyder, container_type: woman, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: red cookies, entity_type: red-heart-cookie, entity_quantity: 36, container_name: Mrs. Snyder, container_type: woman, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: minus red cookies, entity_type: pink-heart-cookie, entity_quantity: 50, container_name: Mrs. Snyder, container_type: woman, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: here we need to use heart-cookie because its visual is different with normal cookie
                
22. Question: Sarah had some trucks. She gave 13 to Jeff, and now she has 38 trucks left. How many trucks did Sarah have to start with?
Visual language: addition(container1[entity_name: trucks, entity_type: truck, entity_quantity: 13, container_name: Jeff, container_type: boy, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: trucks, entity_type: truck, entity_quantity: 38, container_name: left, container_type: left, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: trucks, entity_type: truck, entity_quantity: 51, container_name: Sarah, container_type: girl, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: can emphasize 'left' for this type of question.

23. Question: Mrs. Hilt bought an ice cream cone for 99 cents. How much would 2 ice cream cones cost?
Visual language: addition(container1[entity_name: cent, entity_type: cent, entity_quantity: 99, container_name:ice cream cone, container_type:ice-cream-cone, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: cent, entity_type: cent, entity_quantity: 99, container_name:ice cream cone, container_type:ice-cream-cone, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name: cent, entity_type: cent, entity_quantity: 198, container_name:Mrs. Hilt, container_type:woman, attr_name:, attr_type:])
                
24. Question: Mrs. Hilt bought 6 hot dogs. Each hot dog cost 50 cents. How much money did she pay for all of the hot dogs?

32. Question: To add support on the house's connections, he decided to tie the wood joints with rope. He needs 185 feet of rope. If he has 46 feet of rope with him and at the moment he only needed 57 feet, how many feet of rope did his friends give to him?
Visual language: subtraction(container1[entity_name: required rope, entity_type: rope, entity_quantity: 185, container_name: total need, container_type: total-need, attr_name:, attr_type:], addition(container1[entity_name: current rope, entity_type: rope, entity_quantity: 46, container_name:have , container_type: have, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: needed rope, entity_type: rope, entity_quantity: 57, container_name:current need , container_type:current-need , attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: total rope used, entity_type: rope, entity_quantity: 103, container_name: , container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:]), result_container[entity_name: rope given by friends, entity_type: rope, entity_quantity: 82, container_name: friends, container_type: friend, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: please make sure the container name is representative of the current state like in this example, make it distinguishable. Also if the formula is given, make sure the visual langauge is align with the formula, do not skip steps.

33. Question: Another material that he needs is rope. If he already has 6 feet of rope and he needs additional ropes having 5 times the length of what he already have, how long should be the additional rope?

Note: for this type of 'x times of' question, you should use multiplication operation, and the container2 should be have name and type == multiplier.
                
34. Question: If Lizzie's group is composed of 54 people and they have 17 more members than the other group, how many people are working together to clean the city?

Note: the name and type always corresponding to the questioned item, like here we should use people not group or member, and container is the thing distinguish the belonging of items.

35. Question: Katie spent a total $350.00 on her whole stay in the island. If she spent $125.00 on food and $135.00 on hotel rooms, how much did she spend on buying other stuff?

Du bist ein Experte für die Konvertierung von mathematischen Textaufgaben in eine strukturierte 'visuelle Sprache'. Deine Aufgabe ist es, einen visuellen Sprachausdruck basierend auf der gegebenen mathematischen Textaufgabe zu schreiben.
    **Hintergrundinformationen**
    Du solltest das folgende feste Format für jedes Problem verwenden:
    <operation>(
    container1[entity_name: <Entitätsname>, entity_type: <Typ der Entität>, entity_quantity: <Anzahl der Entität in diesem Container>, container_name: <Container Name>, container_type: <Container Typ>, attr_name: <Attributname>, attr_type: <Attributtyp>],
    container2[entity_name: <Entitätsname>, entity_type: <Typ der Entität>, entity_quantity: <Anzahl der Entität in diesem Container>, container_name: <Container Name>, container_type: <Container Typ>, attr_name: <Attributname>, attr_type: <Attributtyp>],
    result_container[entity_name: <Entitätsname>, entity_type: <Typ der Entität>, entity_quantity: <Anzahl der Entität in diesem Container>, container_name: <Container Name>, container_type: <Container Typ>, attr_name: <Attributname>, attr_type: <Attributtyp>]
    )
    operation kann ``addition'', ``subtraction'', ``multiplication'', ``division'', ``surplus'', ``area'', ``comparison'' oder ``unittrans'' sein.
    
Jede Entität hat die Attribute: entity_name, entity_type, entity_quantity, container_name, container_type, attr_name, attr_type. Name und Typ sind unterschiedlich, zum Beispiel kann eine Frau namens Lucy als entity_name: Lucy, entity_type: girl dargestellt werden. Die Attribute container_name, container_type, attr_name und attr_type sind optional und können je nach verschiedenen Interpretationen variieren, verwende sie nur, wenn du denkst, dass sie notwendig sind, um die Entität zu verdeutlichen.
In der Beschreibung der mathematischen Textaufgabe ``Jake hat morgens drei Äpfel gepflückt...'' könnte container1 wie folgt spezifiziert werden: entity_name: Apfel, entity_type: apple, entity_quantity: 3, container_name: Jake, container_type: boy, attr_name: Morgen, attr_type: morning.
        
**Beispiele**
Wir stellen dir zunächst einige Beispiele vor, bitte verstehe die Logik klar:

1. Question: Marin hat neun Äpfel und Donald hat zwei Äpfel. Wie viele Äpfel haben Marin und Donald zusammen?
Visual language: addition(container1[entity_name: Apfel, entity_type: apple, entity_quantity:9 , container_name: Marin, container_type: girl, attr_name: , attr_type: ],container2[entity_name: Apfel, entity_type: apple, entity_quantity: 2, container_name: Donald, container_type: boy, attr_name: , attr_type: ], result_container[entity_name:Äpfel,entity_type:apple,entity_quantity:11 , container_name:Marin und Donald, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: Hier beschreibt Addition die Berechnungsbeziehung zwischen container1 und container2. Wir wählen die Entität als das Ding, das der Quantität entspricht, so dass die Quantität diese Entität beschreibt. \"entity_type\" repräsentiert den visuellen Darstellungsnamen der Entität, während \"entity_name\" ihr scheinbarer Name ist. Wie ein Junge namens Bob, so \"entity_name\" ist Bob, \"entity_type\" ist boy, weil wir ihn als Jungen visualisieren. container_name und container_type stellen ein Attribut dar, das du für dieses Problem als notwendig erachtest und wir machen dieses Attribut als Container dieser Entität, um eine Besitzrelation zu zeigen, füge es nur hinzu, wenn du denkst, dass es keine Verwirrung stiftet. Wenn alle Entitäten denselben Container haben, gib \"container_name\" und \"container_type\" nur für result_container an und lasse andere Container leer. Gib nur Wert für attr_type, attr_name, wenn du gefunden hast, dass \"container_name\" und \"container_type\" nicht ausreichen, um eine weitere Attribut bereitzustellen, um diese Entität zu identifizieren. Der result_container beschreibt das Ergebnis dieser Berechnung, ihre entity_name ist normalerweise dieselbe wie container1 und container2, ihre entity_quantity ist das Berechnungsergebnis, ihre container_name und container_type beschreiben den Container des Endergebnisses.

2. Question: Wenn Carl insgesamt 89 Briefmarken hat und Kevin 57 hat, wie viele mehr Briefmarken hat Carl als Kevin?
Visual language: "subtraction(container1[entity_name: Briefmarke, entity_type: stamp, entity_quantity: 89, container_name: Carl, container_type: boy, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: Briefmarke, entity_type: stamp, entity_quantity: 57, container_name: Kevin, container_type: boy, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:Briefmarken,entity_type:stamp,entity_quantity:32 , container_name:Carl hat mehr, container_type: more, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: Hier ist Subtraktion eine andere Beziehung. Der result_container hat container_name: Carl hat mehr, und container_type ist more.

3. Question: Es gibt 10 Bücher auf einem Regal. 3 davon sind Geschichtsbücher, 5 davon sind Geografiebücher und der Rest sind Mathematikbücher. Wie viele Mathematikbücher sind auf dem Regal?
Visual language: "subtraction(subtraction(container1[entity_name: Geschichtsbücher insgesamt, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 10, container_name: Regal, container_type: shelf, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: Geschichtsbücher, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 3, container_name: Geschichtsbücher, container_type: history, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: minus Geschichtsbücher, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 7, container_name: , container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:]), container2[entity_name: Geografiebücher, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 5, container_name: Geografiebücher, container_type: geography, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name:Mathematikbücher, entity_type: book, entity_quantity: 2,container_name:Mathematikbücher, container_type:math, attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: Hier ist ein Beispiel für kontinuierliche Subtraktion, wir sollten weniger Beziehungen verwenden wie hier wir nur mehrere Subtraktionen anstatt Subtraktion und Addition verwenden, beachte dass jede einzelne Berechnung einen result_container hat.

4. Question: Für die fünfte Klasse Spiel wurden die Stühle in 27 Reihen mit 16 Stühlen in jeder Reihe gestellt. Wie viele Stühle wurden für das Spiel aufgestellt?
Visual language: "multiplication(container1[entity_name: Stuhl, entity_type: chair, entity_quantity: 16, container_name: Reihe, container_type: row, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: Multiplikator, entity_type: multiplier, entity_quantity: 27, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name:Stühle,entity_type:chair,entity_quantity:432 , container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: Hier ist Multiplikation eine andere Beziehung. Und Reihe/Spalte ist notwendig in der visuellen Darstellung, also setzen wir es in container_name und container_type"

5. Question: Lexie's jüngerer Bruder half dabei, alle Büroklammern in Lexie's Zimmer aufzusammeln. Er konnte 21 Büroklammern sammeln. Wenn er die Büroklammern in 3 Boxen verteilen möchte, wie viele Büroklammern kommen in jede Box?
Visual language: "division(container1[entity_name: Büroklammer, entity_type: paper-clip, entity_quantity: 21, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: Box, entity_type: box, entity_quantity: 3, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: Büroklammern pro Box, entity_type: paper clip per box, entity_quantity: 7, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: Hier ist der Divisor die Box, also hat der result_container Büroklammern pro Box. Wenn die Frage wäre, eine feste Anzahl von Büroklammern pro Box zu haben und zu fragen, wie viele Boxen, dann sollte der result_container Box als Container haben.

6. Question: Es waren 36 Hunde und 29 Katzen in einem Tierheim. Nachdem 20 der Hunde von Leuten adoptiert wurden, sammelte das Tierheim weitere 12 Katzen. Wie viele Tiere waren am Ende im Tierheim?
Visual language: "addition(subtraction(addition(container1[entity_name: Hund, entity_type: dog, entity_quantity: 36, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: Katze, entity_type: cat, entity_quantity: 29, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], \n    result_container[entity_name:Tiere,entity_type:animal,entity_quantity:65,container_name:,container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),container2[entity_name: Hund, entity_type: dog, entity_quantity: 20, container_name: adoptiert, container_type: adopt, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:Tiere,entity_type:animal,entity_quantity:45,container_name:,container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),container2[entity_name: Katze, entity_type: cat, entity_quantity: 12, container_name: gesammelt, container_type: collect, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:Tiere,entity_type:animal,entity_quantity:57,container_name:Tierheim,container_type:pet-center,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: Dieses Beispiel zeigt, dass wir verschachtelte Beziehungen verwenden können, um mehrere Beziehungen auszudrücken. Wir schreiben Berechnungen in Zeitreihenfolge, und da Tierheim die Gesamtergebnisse repräsentiert, setzen wir es nur als Container des letzten result_container.

7. Question: Frau Santiago hat 58 rote Rosen. Frau Garrett hat 24. Was ist der Unterschied in der Anzahl der roten Rosen von Frau Santiago und Frau Garrett?
Visual language: "subtraction(container1[entity_name: rote Rose, entity_type: red-rose, entity_quantity: 58, container_name: Frau Santiago, container_type: woman, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: rote Rose, entity_type: red-rose, entity_quantity: 24, container_name: Frau Garrett, container_type: woman, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name: rote Rosen, entity_type: red-rose, entity_quantity: 34, container_name:Unterschied, container_type:difference, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: Für solche Unterschiedsprobleme verwenden wir immer noch die Subtraktionsbeziehung.

8. Question: Eine Fluggesellschaft hat 41 Gepäckstücke zu verstauen. Wenn jedes Gepäcksfach 5 Gepäckstücke aufnehmen kann, wie viele befinden sich im Fach, das nicht voll ist?
Visual language: "surplus(container1[entity_name: Gepäckstück, entity_type: luggage, entity_quantity: 41, container_name:Fluggesellschaft, container_type:airline, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: Gepäckstück, entity_type: luggage, entity_quantity: 5, container_name:Fach, container_type:compartment, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name: Gepäckstücke,entity_type: luggage, entity_quantity: 1,container_name: Fach,container_type: compartment,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: Hier ist Surplus eine andere Beziehung, wir berechnen den Überschuss von container1 dividiert durch container2.

9. Question: Wenn du einen 10-Dollar-Schein, einen Vierteldollar und einen Nickel hast, wie viel Geld hast du?
Visual language: "addition(addition(unittrans(container1[entity_name: 10-Dollar-Schein, entity_type: ten-dollar-bill, entity_quantity: 1, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: Dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 10, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: Dollar, entity_type: dollar, entity_quantity:10, container_name:, container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),unittrans(container1[entity_name: Vierteldollar, entity_type: quarter, entity_quantity: 1, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: Dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 0.25, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name: Dollar, entity_type:dollar,entity_quantity:0.25,container_name:,container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),result_container[entity_name: Dollar, entity_type:dollar,entity_quantity:10.25,container_name:,container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),unittrans(container1[entity_name: Nickel, entity_type: nickel, entity_quantity: 1, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name: Dollar, entity_type: unittrans_value, entity_quantity: 0.05, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name: Dollar, entity_type:dollar,entity_quantity:0.05,container_name:,container_type:,attr_name:,attr_type:]),result_container[entity_name: Dollar, entity_type:dollar,entity_quantity:10.30,container_name:du,container_type:human,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: Hier bedeutet unittrans Einheitentransformation, es ist eine andere Beziehung zwischen Entität und ihrem unittrans_value. Wie in diesem Beispiel hat ein 10-Dollar-Schein einen Wert von 10 Dollar, so ist der Name von container2 Dollar, der Typ ist unittrans_value, und die Quantität ist 10.

10. Question: Teppich A ist 8 Fuß mal 4 Fuß und Teppich B ist 5 Fuß mal 7 Fuß. Welchen Teppich sollte Frau Hilt kaufen, wenn sie den Teppich mit der größten Fläche möchte?
Visual language: "comparison(area(container1[entity_name: Fuß, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 8, container_name:Länge, container_type:length, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name:Fuß, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 4, container_name:Breite, container_type:width, attr_name:, attr_type:], result_container[entity_name:Fläche,entity_type:area,entity_quantity:32 , container_name:Teppich A, container_type:rug, attr_name:, attr_type:]),area(container1[entity_name: Fuß, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 5, container_name:Länge, container_type:length, attr_name:, attr_type:],container2[entity_name:Fuß, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 7, container_name:Breite, container_type:width, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:Fläche,entity_type:area,entity_quantity:35 , container_name:Teppich B, container_type:rug, attr_name:, attr_type:]),result_container[entity_name:Teppich B,entity_type:rug,entity_quantity: , container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:])
Note: Hier sind Vergleich und Fläche zwei neue Beziehungen. \"comparison\" vergleicht die Quantität von zwei Entitäten, die zwei Entitäten können das Ergebnis anderer Berechnungen sein wie in diesem Beispiel, der Name des result_container zeigt das Vergleichsergebnis an.\n\"area\" berechnet den Flächenwert durch seine zwei Eingabeentitäten, container1 repräsentiert Länge während container2 Breite repräsentiert, wie durch Container angezeigt, Name ist Einheit. Der container_name und container_type des result_container zeigen den Gegenstand, zu dem diese Fläche gehört.

11. Question: Ellen hat sechs Bälle mehr als Marin. Marin hat neun Bälle. Wie viele Bälle hat Ellen?
Visual language: "addition(container1[entity_name: Ball, entity_type: ball, entity_quantity: 9, container_name: Marin, container_type: girl, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: Ball, entity_type: ball, entity_quantity: 6, container_name:, container_type:, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:Bälle,entity_type:ball,entity_quantity:15,container_name:Ellen,container_type:boy,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: In diesem Fall sind die Additionsresultate die Bälle, die Ellen hat, also fügen wir Ellen nicht in den Container von container2 hinzu, weil es Verwirrung stiften würde, dass Ellen 6 Bälle besitzt.

12. Question: Isha's Bleistift ist 22 Zoll lang. Wenn sie montags zwei Zoll und dienstags zwei Zoll abschleift, wie lang wird ihr Bleistift dann sein?
Visual language: "subtraction(subtraction(container1[entity_name: Zoll, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 22, container_name: Bleistift, container_type: pencil, attr_name:, attr_type:], container2[entity_name: Zoll, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 2, container_name: Montag, container_type: calendar, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:Zoll,entity_type:measure,entity_quantity:20,container_name:Bleistift,container_type:pencil,attr_name:,attr_type:]), container2[entity_name: Zoll, entity_type: measure, entity_quantity: 2, container_name: Dienstag, container_type: calendar, attr_name:, attr_type:],result_container[entity_name:Zoll,entity_type:measure,entity_quantity:18,container_name:Bleistift,container_type:pencil,attr_name:,attr_type:])
Note: In diesem Fall, wenn das Attribut ein Name eines Wochentages ist (Montag, Sonntag, gestern, morgen...) oder ein Jahr oder ein Monat, können wir Kalender als Typ verwenden, um es zu visualisieren. Ähnlich wenn es eine Zeit ist, können wir Uhr als Typ verwenden. Und für Zoll oder andere Längen, können wir Maß als Typ verwenden. Der letzte result_container sollte den Gesamtcontainer dieses Gegenstands verwenden, wie Bleistift hier.

13. Question: Die Hawks erzielten drei Touchdowns im Wert von 7 Punkten jeder. Wie viele Punkte haben sie?

Note: Hier ist entity_name Punkt anstatt Touchdown, weil die Quantität 7 dem Punkt entspricht nicht Touchdown, und wir setzen Touchdown in Container als es diese Punkte besitzt. Du kannst dir Multiplikation als Wiederholung einer Box mehrere Male vorstellen, hier ist die Box Touchdown und Punkte sind Gegenstände darin. Und schließlich ist Hawks der Container des result_container als es alle Boxen besitzt.

14. Question: Ein Spielspinner hat 5 gleiche Teile. Zwei Teile sind blau und drei Teile sind lila. Welche Farbe würdest du am wahrscheinlichsten drehen?
